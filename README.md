# take-home-challenge

My goal for the take home challenge was to create a navbar that resembled the mock-up.  

I chose to use materialize as a css framework since I felt it resmebled the mock-up very closely.

Unfortunately, I was not able to hit the minimum required, but would loved to have implemented a working login/logout link that would only show one at a time.
